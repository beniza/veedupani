# Procuring a bank loan
I've contacted two banks, 1) [Kerala Gramin Bank (KGB)](https://keralagbank.com/personal-banking/home-loans) and 2) [Union Bank](https://www.unionbankofindia.co.in/english/retail-loan.aspx)

KGB offer fixed interest rate loans, which KGB manager told me as an attractive option for a person of my age (44 now). With a fixed interest rate, I do not have to be worried about a fluctuating/volatile market.

As of today, KGB's [interest rates](https://keralagbank.com/loan-interest-rates) are as follows
| Loan Category | Interest Rate | Comments |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| Housing Loan General | 9.5%|
| Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana | 9.45% | Upto â‚¹20L. #TODO Find more|

Union bank has a floating interest on their house loan. Their fixed interest loans have a maximum of 5yr tenure.
