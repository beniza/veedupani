# Procuring a loan from the PF
Since both me and my wife are employees, our pf funds are already some money in it. As it is easy to use this money for kickstarting our project, we decided to apply for a loan/early release of money from our pf accounts.

## Where to apply?
You wiill be able to place the request at the [PF's Member e-SEWA portal](https://unifiedportal-mem.epfindia.gov.in/memberinterface/). Sign in to the portal using your Universal Account Number (UAN) and Password. 

Once logged in, go to the Online Services and select the CLAIM (FORM 31,19,10C & 10D) option from there. You will be taken to the page where the info about you will be displayed.

### Things to remember
1. You should be having access to your Aadhar registered phone number with you for placing the request
1. You need to provide the UAN Seeded account number and verify it. 
    * If this account is  joint account, then your request will be rejected (I learned it the hard way)
    * Note:- Please verify your Bank Account Number as seeded against UAN. If seeded bank account doesn't belongs to you or is closed, please update bank details(KYC) with latest Bank Account Number through Unified Portal / Your Employer before proceeding with Online claim.
