# Procuring a bank loan
I've contacted two banks, 1) [Kerala Gramin Bank (KGB)](https://keralagbank.com/personal-banking/home-loans) and 2) [Union Bank](https://www.unionbankofindia.co.in/english/retail-loan.aspx)

## Kerala Gramin Bank
A reliable friend suggested applying the loan from KGB. (He is not directly associated with KGB). Hence I visited their local branch and had a discussion with the manager. She was welcoming and was willing to explain in detail about various aspects about `Home Loans` in general and the `KGB's Home Loan` options.
KGB offer fixed interest rate loans, which she told me as an attractive option for a person of my age (44 now). With a fixed interest rate, I do not have to be worried about a fluctuating/volatile market.

As of today, KGB's [interest rates](https://keralagbank.com/loan-interest-rates) are as follows
| Loan Category | Interest Rate | Comments |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| Housing Loan General | 9.5%|
| Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana | 9.45% | Upto â‚¹20L. #TODO Find more|

## Union Bank
Union bank has a floating interest on their house loan. Their fixed interest loans have a maximum of 5yr tenure. 

My brother had taken his home loan from Union Bank. While the loan was active, the bank and its staff were very cooperative and he was a very satisfied customer. So he encouraged me to try Union bank also as an option. So we visited their branch and talked to the respective officer. She was ready to go for lunch when we reached there, but she stayed back and gave us a brief idea about the loan options. `She insisted that a floating loan is the better option in today's economy`. 

Union Bank's current interest rate is around 6.80% p.a. But I'll get an additional rebate of 0.05 p.a. if my CBIL score is above 700 and LTV (Loan Total Value?) < 75% of the estimate. 

### Other benefits
Union bank offers other benefits as well. 
#### Overdraft facility
A home loan borrower's bank account and surplus funds can be parked in the `  Overdraft Facility` account. The surplus funds over and above the EMI is treated as pre-payments towards the home loan. This brings down the overall loan liability which saves on interest payments. You can even withdraw the surplus when required. Banks offer the overdraft facility to a home loan borrower.

## State Bank of India
My salary account is maintained at SBI (at a Bangalore branch). When I visited my local area branch, they were willing to give me the benefit of the long term customer. My interactions with the Dy. Manager (Loans) were pleasant. He explained the options. In summary, SBI provides home loans at 7.0
